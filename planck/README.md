# QMK configuration files for my Plancks

This has been a bit of a journey, but I think I am getting there now.

I finished updating my Planck keymap recently, so it's mostly the same as the Corne. This makes it very easy to type quickly, and puts modifiers and navigation back to where I now expect them to be. There are still a couple more tweaks I want to experiment with, but in a push this could definitely be my main or only keyboard as it stands now. The Black on White keycaps also work really well, and help my fingers remember where everything is. I'm still using this with Kailh Speed Coppers, which are still my favourite switch for actually typing on (especially when noise isn't a problem).
