# QMK configuration files for my Planck rev7

My keymap is mostly the same as the Corne (and my other Plancks), in that every key that the two keyboards share does _exactly_ the same thing. This makes it very easy to type quickly, and puts modifiers and navigation back to where I now expect them to be. The outer keys on the bottom row are used to give easier access to navigation keys and modifiers, but I find I don't actually use them that much. The only thing this keyboard is _definitely_ better for is using on my work laptop (running Windows 10). The extra windows key and arrows are quite useful sometimes, although I have all these things on layer on my other keyboards so could adapt in not a lot of time at all.

There are still a couple more tweaks I want to experiment with, but in a push this could definitely be my main or only keyboard as it stands now. 

Although the keymap is the same, the config isn't. This Planck has more scope for rotary encoders, and as a result needs slightly different firmware.
