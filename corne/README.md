# Notes on my Corne Configuration

The Corne is a 42-key mechanical keyboard. These are my notes on building and configuring it. Largely for my own benefit.

The Corne I'm using is the RTG model, ordered from [Mechboards](https://mechboards.co.uk/). I am currently part way through building one from scratch as well though.

Currently I'm using [this case](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1179555093/high-profile-corne-3dp-case) which make it look a lot better, as well as being significantly more stable on my desk. I've also now screwed the original base on to the bottom to give even more stability.

This is what my keyboard currently looks like:

I'm close to getting the [keymap](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/blob/main/corne/keymap.c) how I want it, although it is still a work in progress, The defaults are sensible, but I want this to be interchangeable with the Planck and so I have moved a few things around and added macros for things I do often.

On this side there is a number pad on a layer, plus additional functionality hidden below the modifiers.

On this side I have navigation on one layer, and commonly used symbols on another.

As with all my keyboards, I'm using `AUTO_SHIFT_ENABLE` to remove the need to use a modifier when I am typing normal text.

I have used this periodically for a few months, and it is currently my main keyboard.
