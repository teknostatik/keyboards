# Notes on my Corne Configuration

_The Corne is a 42-key mechanical keyboard. These are my notes on building and configuring it. Largely for my own benefit._

The Corne I'm using is the RTG model, ordered from [Mechboards](https://mechboards.co.uk/). I am currently part way through building one from scratch as well though.

Currently I'm using the [default black case](https://mechboards.co.uk/products/helidox-corne-case?variant=40336262070477) with Oil King switches, although I do have a fancier case on order.

This is what my keyboard currently looks like:

I'm close getting the keymap how I want it, although it is still a work in progress, The defaults are sensible, but I want this to be interchangeable with the Planck and so I have moved a few things around and added macros for things I do often.

As with all my keyboards, I'm using `AUTO_SHIFT_ENABLE` to remove the need to use a modifier when I am typing normal text.

I have used this periodically for a few months, and it is currently my main keyboard.
