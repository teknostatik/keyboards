# Notes on my 36-key Corne Configuration

The Corne is a 42-key mechanical keyboard, but can be reduced to 36 keys. I try and use the same keymap where possible, but found that I really needed an _enter_ key on layer one, and so created this fork.

The Corne I'm using was ordered from [Mechboards](https://mechboards.co.uk/), and is a very minimal build. I wanted to see if using only 36 keys was possible, and so far it's definitely something I want to explore further.
