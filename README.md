# Ortholinear Keymaps

This repository contains the configuration for my ortholinear keyboards. There is nothing revolutionary about these at the moment, but that may change as I become more proficient.

Configuration for keyboards I own:

* [Planck](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/planck)
* [Preonic](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/preonic)
* [Corne](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/corne)

Coming soon: my first take on a few keyboards I would _like_ to own.

All very much a work in progress, and should be reviewed carefully before using.
