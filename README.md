# Mechanical Keyboard keymaps

This repository contains the QMK keymaps for my keyboards. 

## Current daily drivers

* [Corne](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/corne) - a split keyboard with 3x6 column staggered keys and 3 thumb keys (I'm also now working on the [3x5 version](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/corne36))
* [Ferris Sweep](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/ferris_sweep) - a 34-key split board with an aggressive stagger

## keyboards I own and have used

* [Planck](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/planck) - a 40% ortholinear keyboard
* [Preonic](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/preonic) - like a Planck, but with a number row
* [HS60](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/HHKB) - a 60% keyboard that uses the HHKB layout
* [unix60](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/unix60) - another HHKB layout (ISO this time) for a board I have just built

## Work in progress

* [DZ60](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/dz60rgb_ansi) - a standard 60% ANSI keyboard
* [ok60](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/ok60) - a 60% keyboard with a custom ISO keymap. I built this to learn how to solder, and will probably tweak it a lot more soon.
* [Gherkin](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/gherkin) - a 30-key keyboard that I'm working on a custom keymap for
* [Cantor](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/cantor) - a low-profile staggered keyboard with the same layout as the Corne. I've not built this one yet, but the firmware does compile.
