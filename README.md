# Mechanical Keyboard keymaps

This repository contains the QMK keymaps for my keyboards. 

## Current daily drivers

* [Ferris Sweep](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/ferris_sweep) - a 34-key split board with an aggressive stagger
* [Corne](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/corne) - a split keyboard with 3x6 column staggered keys and 3 thumb keys

## keyboards I own and have used

* [Planck](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/planck) - a 40% ortholinear keyboard
* [Preonic](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/preonic) - like a Planck, but with a number row
* [HS60](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/HHKB) - a 60% keyboard that uses the HHKB layout
* [unix60](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/unix60) - another HHKB layout (ISO this time) for a board I have just built
* [Cantor](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/cantor) - a low-profile staggered keyboard with the same layout as the Corne
* [Iris](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/iris) - a split 50% keyboard 

## Work in progress

* [Gherkin](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/gherkin) - a 30-key keyboard that I'm working on a custom keymap for
* [Tidbit](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/tidbit) - a fully programmable number pad
