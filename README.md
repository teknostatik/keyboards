# Mechanical Keyboard keymaps

This repository contains the configuration for my keyboards. There is nothing revolutionary about these at the moment, but that may change as I become more proficient.

Configuration for keyboards I own and have built:

* [Planck](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/planck) - a 40% ortholinear keyboard
* [Preonic](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/preonic) - like a Planck, but with a number row
* [Corne](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/corne) - a 42-key split ortholinear keyboard
* [HS60](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/HHKB) - a 60% keyboard that uses the HHKB layout
* [DZ60](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/dz60rgb_ansi) - a standard 60% keyboard that I don't recommend right now

Work in progress:

* [ok60](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/ok60) - a 60% keyboard with a custom ISO keymap
