# Cantor

My keymap is mostly the same as the Corne, but I have taken advantage of the larger amount of storage to add some extra tap dances using Vial.

This is currently under very active development, but there is a keymap in this directory that can be imported into Vial and applied to a keyboard already running the Vial firmware.

## Build guide

I've been building a few of these with low profile switches and (mostly) blank key caps. I'm working on a [build guide](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/blob/main/cantor/cantor_build_guide.md) which I will add to as I learn more.
