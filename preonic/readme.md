# Preonic keymap

This is my default Preonic keymap. I use a Preonic every day now, so they keymap is customised to include they keys I use the most. Main features are:

* `RGBLIGHT_ENABLE = no`
* `AUTO_SHIFT_ENABLE = yes`
* Move keys on LH side around
* Replace `KC_GRV` with `KC_PGDN`
* Replace `KC_DEL` with `KC_LBRC`
* Replace `BACKLIT` with `KC_F5`
