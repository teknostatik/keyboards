# HHKB HS60 V2

Default layer is normal HHKB with 7U space. Fn layer is used for RGB functions, volume control and arrow cluster.

All I have done is add autoshift and move the modifiers and navigation keys to where I expect them to be.

This layout can be fully accommodated with any MT3 base kit. I only ever pick these up when they are well under half-price, but they are definitely my favourite profile.

All the other parts for this one came from Mechboards, and were bought at half-price or under. So this very much ended up as a budget build.

I very much recommend the HS60 boards for any project where you don't want to solder, or where you want a board to test out loads of different switches and keycaps (which is what I do with this one).

I have just built a second one of these with silent switches and black keycaps. That may end up at work soon, as I don't really have a use for it at home.
