# Ferris Sweep

My keymap is mostly the same as the Corne, but I have had to combine two of my usual thumb cluster keys into one on both sides. It's surprisingly easy to get used to, and I may very well do something similar on other keyboards.

This is currently under very active development, so there is likely to be a mismatch between the image above and the actual keymap.

## Alternate firmware

I've also got a [custom build](https://github.com/teknostatik/keyboards/tree/main/ferris_sweep_mechboards) that works with the version of the Ferris Sweep from Mechboards.

## Future plans

I have ordered some PCBs so I can prototype a low-profile version of this. The plan is to try choc switches and keycaps, and forgo a case.
